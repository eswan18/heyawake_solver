# Heyawake Solver

Heyawake puzzles are grid-based boards with clues about which boxes should be shaded and which should not. The starting board has no boxes shaded, but the "player" shades boxes based on the given information.

In terms of play and logic, Heyawake is fairly similar to the popular Sudoku puzzle.
